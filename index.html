    <p style="font-size: 120%"> Henry Edward Roberts, an engineer, entrepreneur, and medical doctor who invented the first personal computer. Henry Roberts was born in Miami, Florida, United States, on September 13, 1941. Roberts founded the Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry System or MITS in 1970. MITS’s goal was to make and sell an electronic kit to model rockery hobbyists, but the first successful product he sold was an electronic calculator. But in 1971 calculators started selling cheap so Roberts shifted his idea to a "low cost build it yourself computer",Roberts said "It's for tecno nerds only”. <br> 
    The Altair 8800 was the first personal computer ever built. When it was introduced in 1975 on the cover of Popular Electronics the technology went wild, inspiring young Bill Gates and his friend Paul Allen to found Microsoft, they later became Roberts’ pioneers. With Roberts hardware, Microsoft’s programming, and Apple’s keyboard and monitor and we have the personal computer that we have today. Said Roberts “We created an industry, every aspect, you name it.”. <br> 
    Roberts sold MITS in 1977 and later retired to Georgia. In April 1st 2010 in Cochran, Georgia, United States, is when and where Henry Roberts died from pneumonia. </p>
